# Weather-Me-Now-Proposal

For my project proposal I would like to create a Weather Web App. The user will be able to type in a city of their choosing and the current weather on that location. I plan on using weatherstack api to get the data for the weather.  

### Stretch Goals

- Save inputted locations.
- Option to display forecast instead of current weather.
